# Cloud Web Application Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of cloud application development and deployment, emphasizing robust security, availability, and scalability.

## Key Features

### RESTful Application Development & Enhanced CI
- Developed a scalable RESTful application with a focus on maintaining high-quality code through Continuous Integration (CI) via GitHub Actions.
- Integrated detailed logging and metrics to ensure effective monitoring and performance analysis of the application.

### Application Scaling and Event-Driven Architecture
- Implemented AutoScaling to dynamically manage capacity, targeting CPU utilization for optimal performance.
- Leveraged Google Cloud Pub/Sub to enable an efficient, event-driven architecture for real-time processing.

### Robust Infrastructure Deployment with Security
- Deployed a secure Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure with a focus on network and resource isolation.
- Enforced strict access controls and security best practices using IAM roles and security groups.
- Configured an Application Load Balancer to accept only HTTPS requests, enhancing data security in transit with SSL/TLS certificates managed through GCP's managed Certificate.
- Utilized Cloud DNS for reliable domain registration and DNS management.

### Cloud Functions for Automation
- Integrated GCP Cloud Functions to automate responses to specific events, streamlining operations and improving efficiency.

### Encryption
- Employed Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to manage encryption for Cloud SQL, Instance Templates, and Bucket Storage.
